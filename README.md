Project Description
pothmeter:  

A web app to measure pothole dimensions using photos. Features:  
Camera/upload – Capture or upload images with a reference object (ruler/coin)  
Measure – Length, area, and water volume (with depth input)  
Easy scaling – Set reference length for accurate measurements  
No backend – Works fully in your browser                                                                                                                                     
The Problem (that doesn't exist)   
["Normal people look at potholes and see problems - we see beautiful elliptical cylinders waiting to be measured!" ]

The Solution (that nobody asked for)
Why use boring measuring tapes when you can:  
1. Play with your phone camera  
2. Doodle like a toddler  
3. Get government-grade measurements
